In the same way, create a concrete ATarget called Dummy, the type of which
is "Target Practice Dummy". You must also implement its clone() method.

Add to the Warlock the following member functions:

* learnSpell, takes a pointer to ASpell, that makes the Warlock learn a spell
* forgetSpell, takes a string corresponding a to a spell's name, and makes the
  Warlock forget it. If it's not a known spell, does nothing.
* launchSpell, takes a string (a spell name) and a reference to ATarget, that
  launches the spell on the selected target. If it's not a known spell, does
  nothing.

You will need a new attribute to store the spells your Warlock knows. Several
types fit the bill, it's up to you to choose the best one.

Below is a possible test main and its expected output:

int main()
{
  Warlock richard("Richard", "the Titled");

  Dummy bob;
  Fwoosh* fwoosh = new Fwoosh();

  richard.learnSpell(fwoosh);

  richard.introduce();
  richard.launchSpell("Fwoosh", bob);

  richard.forgetSpell("Fwoosh");
  richard.launchSpell("Fwoosh", bob);
}

~$ ./a.out | cat -e
Richard: This looks like another boring day.$
Richard: I am Richard, the Titled!$
Target Practice Dummy has been fwooshed!$
Richard: My job here is done!$
